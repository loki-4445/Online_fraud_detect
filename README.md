Online Payment Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

Description

This project compares three different classification models for detecting online payment fraud. It aims to identify the most effective model for distinguishing fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones. This project is intended for data scientists, machine learning enthusiasts, and financial institutions looking to enhance fraud detection mechanisms.

Project Overview

This project compares the following three classification models:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

XGBoost Classifier

The models are trained on an online payment transaction dataset. The primary goal is to determine which model performs best in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Key Features:

Preprocessing Steps: Data cleaning, handling missing values, feature engineering.

Model Training: Hyperparameter tuning for optimal results.

Evaluation Metrics: ROC-AUC, confusion matrix, precision-recall curves.

Comparison & Insights: Discussion on model strengths and weaknesses.
